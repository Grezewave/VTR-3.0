For use VTR, you need do some external settings in your machine.

Download python:
https://www.python.org/

Add python in enviroment variables(windows only):
Go to enviroment variabels settings and add in path fields, the path of the folder
that is the python installation

Download Pymol:
https://pymol.org/

Add Pymol in enviroment variables(windows only):
Go to enviroment variabels settings and add in path fields, the path of the folder
Scripts that is in the Pymol installation folder

Download MinGW:
https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/downloads/68260/mingw-get-setup.exe/

Add g++.exe path in enviroment variables(windows only):
Go to enviroment variabels settings and add in path fields, the path of the folder
bin that is in the MinGW installation folder

Installation complete, now, you need put the target proteins in the folder Data,
that is in VTR extraction folder, in this folder, there's 2 proteins of globin type
for tests, you can add more proteins in the folder by copy .pdb files to the folder.

For VTR first run, just double click the .py file "VTR" in Source folder, after,
you can use the software by this way, or import the VTR_Geometric python file, and
call function:

>> Matches_lists,Protein1_dismatches_list,Protein2_dismatches_list = VTR_Geometric.main(protein1's_path,protein2's_path,*args,**kwargs)

kwargs:
int cutoff   = Cutoff to AVD (Default = 2)
char mtype    = 'd' for detailed graphic information (Default = 'x'(No details))
char chain11 = First chain to be filtered in the contact calculation of protein 1 (Default = '/'(All))
char chain11 = Second chain to be filtered in the contact calculation of protein 1 (Default = '/'(All))
char chain11 = First chain to be filtered in the contact calculation of protein 2 (Default = '/'(All))
char chain11 = Second chain to be filtered in the contact calculation of protein 2 (Default = '/'(All))

Exemple:
1 - Run VTR with default parameters:
>> import VTR_Geometric

>> Matches_lists,Protein1_dismatches_list,Protein2_dismatches_list = VTR_Geometric.main(protein1's_path,protein2's_path)


2 - Run VTR with details and different cutoff:
>> import VTR_Geometric

>> Matches_lists,Protein1_dismatches_list,Protein2_dismatches_list = VTR_Geometric.main(protein1's_path,protein2's_path,cutoff=3,mtyp = 'd')

3 - Run VTR with selected chains:
>> import VTR_Geometric

>> Matches_lists,Protein1_dismatches_list,Protein2_dismatches_list = VTR_Geometric.main(protein1's_path,protein2's_path,chain11 = 'A',chain12 = 'B',chain21 = 'C',chain22 = 'D')
